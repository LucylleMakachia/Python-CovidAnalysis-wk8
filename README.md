## How to Share the Report

The report is generated as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file. Here are several ways to share it:

1.  **Download as .ipynb:** Share the downloaded .ipynb file directly.  Anyone with Jupyter installed can open and run it.

2.  **Share via GitHub:** Upload the notebook to a GitHub repository.  Share the GitHub URL of the notebook for viewing.  Others can clone the repository to run the notebook.

3.  **Export as HTML:** Export the notebook as a static HTML file.  This allows others to view the notebook (including output and visualizations) in a web browser, without needing Jupyter.  To share via a link, you can upload the HTML file to a web server and share the resulting URL.

4.  **Use nbviewer:** Use nbviewer to render the notebook from a public URL (e.g., a GitHub repository).  Share the nbviewer URL for others to view.

5.  **Google Colab:** Upload the notebook to Google Drive and open it with Google Colab.  Share it directly from Colab using Google's sharing features, which provide a shareable link.
